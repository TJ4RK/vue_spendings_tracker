**Vue Spendings Tracker**
=========================

**About:**
----------
I decided to learn a bit about webdevelopment (vue and node to be specific, after I already familiarised myself with basic HTML/CSS/Javascript). 
Because I learn the best, when I am working on something that might be actually usefull, I decided to code a little spendings tracker.
Since this is my first "real project" with these technologies, there are probably a ton of beginner mistakes and things you shouldnt be doing in general,
but since this app was mainly build for learning purposes, I am quite happy with the outcome and will probably continue teaching myself about webdev. 
To add to that, all the terminology I am using in this readme is based on what I learned while coding this project, 
so if I use something in the wrong context, I just didnt know any better at the time of writing this.

**Technical:**
--------------
On the frontend there is a vue3 webapp running, which was based on the autogenerated vite base website.
The "backend" is a simple node/express server with a "api" class, which handles the routing for CRUD request of the frontend.
The "databse" is probably the pinicale of jank, because it is just a simple JSON file. 
I decided to do this, because I was mainly focusing on the frontend part and as said this was build for learning purposes first,
I just didnt want to bother with a full database (like mongoDB, MySQL, etc.).

**Install & Run**
-----------------
To run this webapp locally yourself, follow the steps below:
````
1. "Clone the repository"
2. "cd into the cloned folder"
3. npm run build
4. node server.js
````
